## My Help Desk

My Help Desk is a Spring Boot maven project that allows users to sign in and view and manage requests for their computers. 
Users can either sign up for an accout or sign in to their accounts to start making requests. 
The help desk also allows for the system admin and technician to update and manage user requests.
